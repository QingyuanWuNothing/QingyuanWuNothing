# The Song of All’s End  

---

## I  
All men adore the immortal’s way,  
Yet fame and rank still make them stay.  
Where are those lords of ancient grace?  
A mound of weeds hides every place.  

---

## II  
All men adore the immortal’s peace,  
Yet greed for gold will never cease.  
They toil for wealth both night and day;  
When coffins close, it fades away.  

---

## III  
All men adore the immortal’s rest,  
Yet beauty still enchants the breast.  
While living, sweet are vows of love;  
In death — she weds another dove.  

---

## IV  
All men adore the immortal’s reign,  
Yet for their sons they still remain.  
Parents’ hearts are fond and sore;  
But filial love? Who’s seen it more?
