# The Song of All’s End  

---

## I  
All men revere the immortal way,  
Yet fame and rank still make them stay.  
Where are the lords of ancient grace?  
A mound of weeds hides every place.  

---

## II  
All men revere the immortal peace,  
Yet greed for gold shall never cease.  
They toil for wealth through night and day;  
When coffins close, it fades away.  

---

## III  
All men revere the immortal rest,  
Yet beauty still enchants the breast.  
In life, love’s vows are fondly wove;  
In death — she weds another dove.  

---

## IV  
All men revere the immortal reign,  
Yet for their sons they still remain.  
Parents’ hearts are soft and sore;  
But filial love — who sees it more?
